rust-by-example
===============

Short programs to show style and features of Rust code.

Rust by example is inspired by the 'Go by example' website by mmcgarana.

As Rust is a new language and still doesn't have a set style, some examples may
have multiple implementations until the coding guidelines are more normalized.

# Building Examples
NOTE: the current state/life of rustpkg is in flux. A better solution than the
one given below is in the works.

The easiest way to build the examples at the moment is to directly use the rust
compiler.

example:
    $ rustc ./hello_world.rs
    $ ./hello_world
